/Users/worsher/code/self/pocket-code/packages/app/modules/pocket-terminal-module/android/build.gradle:64: Warning: A newer version of com.facebook.fbjni:fbjni than 0.5.1 is available: 0.7.0 [NewerVersionAvailable]
    implementation 'com.facebook.fbjni:fbjni:0.5.1'
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewerVersionAvailable":
   This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
   versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is
   similar to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions
   available in the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any
   MavenCentral dependency, and connects to the library every time, which
   makes it more flexible but also much slower.

   Explanation for issues of type "Aligned16KB":
   Android has traditionally used 4 KB memory page sizes. However, to support
   future devices that only work with 16 KB aligned libraries apps containing
   native libraries need to be built with 16 KB alignment.

   Apps with 4 KB aligned native libraries may not work correctly on devices
   requiring 16 KB alignment. To ensure compatibility and future-proof your
   app, it is strongly recommended that your native libraries are aligned to
   16 KB boundaries.

   If your app uses any NDK libraries, directly or indirectly through an SDK,
   you should rebuild your app to meet this recommendation. Make sure all
   native libraries within your application, including those from
   dependencies, are built with 16 KB page alignment.

   This lint check looks at all native libraries that your app depends on. If
   any are found to be aligned to 4 KB instead of 16 KB, you will need to
   address this.

   When a library is flagged, first try to update to a newer version that
   supports 16 KB alignment. If an updated version is not available, contact
   the library vendor to ask about their plans for 16 KB support and request a
   compatible version. Updating your libraries proactively will help ensure
   your app works properly on a wider range of devices.

/Users/worsher/code/self/pocket-code/packages/app/modules/pocket-terminal-module/android/src/main/java/expo/modules/pocketterminalmodule/PocketTerminalModuleView.kt:10: Warning: Custom view PocketTerminalModuleView is missing constructor used by tools: (Context) or (Context,AttributeSet) or (Context,AttributeSet,int) [ViewConstructor]
class PocketTerminalModuleView(context: Context, appContext: AppContext) : ExpoView(context, appContext) {
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ViewConstructor":
   Some layout tools (such as the Android layout editor) need to find a
   constructor with one of the following signatures:
   * View(Context context)
   * View(Context context, AttributeSet attrs)
   * View(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle)

   If your custom view needs to perform initialization which does not apply
   when used in a layout editor, you can surround the given code with a check
   to see if View#isInEditMode() is false, since that method will return false
   at runtime but true within a user interface editor.
